# Grid-Hack

GOAL
The intent of this project is to recreate the experience provided via the 90's board game Hero Quest in a web browser. This is to be achieved by implementing the rules as close to the original rule set as possible. The long term goals are to:
-> Implement a game engine
-> Single player
-> Multi-player
-> Campaign editor

BACKGROUND
The reason for working on this project is both for fun and also to maintain my programming experience, with a particular interest in the development of browser applications. To this extent the use of Javascript has been limited to vanilla ECMA and going forward will continue to endeavour avoiding the use of 3rd party Javascript libraries. However, it is forseeable that Node.js will be required in order to facilitate a multiplayer capacity at a later date.
