TO DO
=============================================================================================

-	nice graphical layout for actions
-	visual map boundary (important for some rare instances like walk through walls, etc)
-	update graphics for agents:
		Barbarian
		Elf
		Dwarf
		Wizard
		Goblin
		Orc
		Zombie
		Skeleton
		Gargoyle
		Witch Lord
		Fimir
		Chaos Warrior
		Mummy

-	A* search algorithm
		General AStar search that does not predicate an agent
		Maybe add options for what should/should not block the search path and write a
		'can move' function that does not rely on the use of the agent 'canMove'
		fix last move check in A* search to include scenario when creatures are in a row more
		two deep, thus preventing movement form further away than originally predicted
-	include an unarmed base attack value for all agents?

-	may need to include a map max x and y values to determine whether or not movement remains
	in the map even if a cell has not been initialized.

-	change the pathing to include a check for weapon range

-	add a ray cast check for weapon line of sight

-	update the gh.Agent.getDefenceDice to include armour checks in the total value

-	Add a turn counter for each player (and agent?)

-	Attack: Add a damage animation
-	Attack: Add a death animation
-	Attack: line of sight overlay5
-	Attack: custom cursor

-	gh.ptrActiveLevel.mapData.map.aStar: add a trim function to remove the starting squares 
		already occupied by agents.  This should prevent AI from finishing a move in a square with
		an allied agent.

-	Search for traps: implement funcitonality
-	Search for secret doors: implement functionality
-	Search for treasure: implement functionality
-	Search: custom cursor

-	Cell.setMouseFocus: add a check for agent focus and animation (probably an overlay effect)
-	Cell.setMouseFocus: include check for items/objects

-	AI: Determine best player to attack
-	AI: consider using a modified A* to get map distance between two objects to account for
		walls and other items between agents
-	AI: game sometimes locks down during AI movement. Need to isolate reason for problem and debug.


-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY: improve graphics
-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY: Change the aaName value to the agent's 'name' attribute rather than
		the 'uniqueID' value.
-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY: The displayed inventory is currently updated only on an EndTurn()
		event. While this reduces the number of times the DOM is modified, it should be remembered
		that a players inventory might be modified during its turn whith items being added
		or removed, and thus should also trigger a refresh of the inventory displayed.

-	graphics.spriteStrip: add error handling for the use of an index

-	End Turn: button should not function while AI turn.

-	Agent: add 'name' attribute.  There should be a default value for each template resRef
		which can be altered for players who whish to provide a different name for their
		heroes.

-	GAME: win/loose condition on all monsters/players heroes dead.

-	gh.getItemsAt: Need to include a width/height check for multicell items to correctly
		determine if an item exists at a particular location.

-	monsters with an inital y coordinate of 0 are being placed at a y coordinate of -1

-	ARMOUR: movement effect of plate mail

-	json.getInventory: Expand to include all item types.

-	Door: diagonal use of door should be stoped.



=============================================================================================
COMPLETED
=============================================================================================

-	add weapon to character
-	fix ratio in sprite display
-	set AI creature to active when viewed
-	change image states on end turn
-	space to center on active agent
-	include a path finding algorithm
		AStar functionality for an agent
-	start integrating AI
		Move toward player
-	implement actions
		Attack

-	AI: implement a move to closes player
-	AI: introduce delay for visuals in agent movement
-	AI: Attack a player

-	Attack: Add check for adjacent vs diagonal
-	Attack: Update feedback via splash screens 

-	fix error in getline when in a 0 y cell (must be in the vision raycasting algorithms?)

-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY:
		current health
		current mind
		current weapon (damage)
		current armor equiped (total defence)

-	implement an attack/defence dice splash screen display

-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY: setting height to 100% does not work when switching between tabs. Need to
		consider using a fixed pixel height value for the canvas.  Perhaps a % of the total
		screen height.

-	Cell: include draw rotation for tiles

-	Items: need to implement this

-	Agent: add blood splatter on death.

-	ARMOUR: add to defence value?
