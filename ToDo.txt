TO DO
=============================================================================================

-	nice graphical layout for actions
-	visual map boundary (important for some rare instances like walk through walls, etc)
-	update graphics for agents:
		Barbarian
		Elf
		Dwarf
		Wizard
		Goblin
		Orc
		Zombie
		Skeleton
		Gargoyle
		Witch Lord
		Fimir
		Chaos Warrior
		Mummy
-	A* search algorithm
		General AStar search that does not predicate an agent
		Maybe add options for what should/should not block the search path and write a
		'can move' function that does not rely on the use of the agent 'canMove'
		fix last move check in A* search to include scenario when creatures are in a row more
		two deep, thus preventing movement form further away than originally predicted
-	include an unarmed base attack value for all agents?
-	may need to include a map max x and y values to determine whether or not movement remains
	in the map even if a cell has not been initialized.
-	implement an attack/defence dice splash screen display
-	change the pathing to include a check for weapon range
-	add a ray cast check for weapon line of sight
-	update the gh.Agent.getDefenceDice to include armour checks in the total value

-	Add a turn counter for each player (and agent?)

-	Attack: Update feedback via splash screens 
-	Attack: Add a damage animation
-	Attack: Add a death animation
-	Attack: line of sight overlay5
-	Attack: custom cursor

-	Search for traps: implement funcitonality
-	Search for secret doors: implement functionality
-	Search for treasure: implement functionality
-	Search: custom cursor

-	Cell.setMouseFocus: add a check for agent focus and animation (probably an overlay effect)
-	Cell.setMouseFocus: include check for items/objects
-	Cell: include draw rotation for tiles

-	AI: Attack a player
-	AI: Determine best player to attack
-	AI: consider using a modified A* to get map distance between two objects to account for
		walls and other items between agents

-	Items: need to implement this

-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY: when adjusting screen size height can enter a loop where it
		increases without stopping and exceeds screen height.

-	graphics.spriteStrip: add error handling for the use of an index

-	End Turn: button should not function while AI turn.


=============================================================================================
COMPLETED
=============================================================================================

-	add weapon to character
-	fix ratio in sprite display
-	set AI creature to active when viewed
-	change image states on end turn
-	space to center on active agent
-	include a path finding algorithm
		AStar functionality for an agent
-	start integrating AI
		Move toward player
-	implement actions
		Attack
-	AI: implement a move to closes player
-	AI: introduce delay for visuals in agent movement
-	Attack: Add check for adjacent vs diagonal
-	fix error in getline when in a 0 y cell (must be in the vision raycasting algorithms?)
-	ACTIVE AGENT DISPLAY:
		current health
		current mind
		current weapon (damage)
		current armor equiped (total defence)
