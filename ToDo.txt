TO DO
=============================================================================================

-	line of sight overlay for attack range
-	active agent overlay updates to include:
		current health
		current mind
		current weapon (damage)
		current armor equiped (total defence)
-	nice graphical layout for actions
-	merge the search into two functions, a general search for treasure/secret doors and a
	search for traps?
-	custom cursors to reflect desired action
-	visual map boundary (important for some rare instances like walk through walls, etc)
-	update graphics for agents:
		Barbarian
		Elf
		Dwarf
		Wizard
		Goblin
		Orc
		Zombie
		Skeleton
		Gargoyle
		Witch Lord
		Fimir
		Chaos Warrior
		Mummy
-	A* search algorithm
		General AStar search that does not predicate an agent
		Maybe add options for what should/should not block the search path and write a
		'can move' function that does not rely on the use of the agent 'canMove'
		fix last move check in A* search to include scenario when creatures are in a row more
		two deep, thus preventing movement form further away than originally predicted
-	start integrating AI
		Attack a player
		Determine best player to attack
-	integrate items
-	implement actions
		Attack
		Search (treasure, secrets, traps)
-	fix focus when mouse no longer over item in a different cell
-	include tile rotation
-	fix error in getline when in a 0 y cell (must be in the vision raycasting algorithms?)
-	include an unarmed base attack value for all agents?
-	may need to include a map max x and y values to determine whether or not movement remains
	in the map even if a cell has not been initialized.
-	implement an attack/defence dice splash screen display
-	introduce delay for visuals in agent movement
-	change the pathing to include a check for weapon range
-	add a ray cast check for weapon line of sight
-	update the gh.Agent.getDefenceDice to include armour checks in the total value

		AStar functionality for an agent
-	start integrating AI
		Move toward player
